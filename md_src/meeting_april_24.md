We have some freestyle text in the LaTeX. We mainly want to know what to include in the different sections, and how to structure it.

# Questions

- Can we have an appendix? Should we put the weight formulation in there?
<!-- - Should the 'problems' (section: Challenges in data blabla) be in the background or methods? -->
- Is measurement of training data quality in methods or results (experiments)?

- What to do in competition graphs?
    - Function of generation: they are pretty equal
    - function of playouts: endgame is king
    - function of 5x playouts: equal?

- should we write in background that it is hard to assess performance of the algorithm

- How to do double-column figures
    - is it allowed
    - what if it is not allowed

- How to interleave results from connect4 and breakthrough in the results section?
    - Should we have a section "Experiments with connect4", and another one for breakthrough?


- Should we give hyperparameter values in the paper? Or should that just be in the code?

- What to put in affiliations?
