# TODO 

## Implement other improvements
- Increasing MCTS playouts through training
- Dynamic training window
- Playout cap randomization

## Competition results for improvements
- Make graph with all improvements vs default.
    - cache the data again
    - evaluate the training data
    - make the graphs again

## Get competition results for Connect4
- Test other improvements on connect4


## Fix performance graph for Connect4
- The number of playouts is possibly not correct, as we only sum the weights (I think), and do not take `min_playouts` into account.


## Write paper
- Write methods
- Iterate


# Done
