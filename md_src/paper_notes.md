How to do double-column figures
- is it allowed
- what if it is not allowed


should we write in background that it is hard to assess performance of the algorithm

Mention more obviously that the evaluation methods are only for Connect4

Competition graphs missing

Mention somewhere before methods (introduction) that we will use connect4 as a testbed, then we generalize to breakthrough.

Should we give hyperparameter values in the paper? Or should that just be in the code?

How to interleave results from connect4 and breakthrough in the results section?
